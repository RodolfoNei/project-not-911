# Contributing to Not911
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## There are several projects here
You'll notice that this repo is a mono-repo. Meaning that everything related to the Not911 project lives here. That means both the android app, the marketing site, and the web app live here.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (we are in the process of documenting how this be run and done - hold tight).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request, and don't forget to note which project you are contributing to!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code if possible
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or anything you tried that didn't work)

A thorough bug report greatly increase the chance it will be fixed!
