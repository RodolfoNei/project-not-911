## About Not911
As it says on the website:

> Not911 is designed to direct you to New York City-based organizations that offer counseling, mediation and intervention services.

Not911 is not perfect. It is an MVP, an idea that we hope will gain traction.

It is missing many potentially useful features, hotlines, etc, and is currently only available in NYC.

But we want to make it better - that is why we've made it open source. The more the community contributes, the better it will be.
